I’m a Data Scientist at [Google](http://hooli.com/). In 2017 I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics and Operations Research (STOR) at UNC Chapel Hill. My research interests include machine learning methods for networks, and computational genomics. My thesis advisors were [Andrew Nobel](http://nobel.web.unc.edu/) and [Shankar Bhamidi](http://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/). Throughout my degree I was an active member of a working group in the [GTEX Project](https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx), and part of the [Probability Group at UNC](http://probabilitygroup.web.unc.edu/).
