I’m a Data Scientist at [Google](http://hooli.com/) working on graph clustering algorithms, network embeddings, user behavior modeling, and natural language understanding. In 2017 I completed a Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics and Operations Research (STOR) at UNC Chapel Hill. My research interests include machine learning methods for networks and computational genomics. My thesis advisors were [Andrew Nobel](http://nobel.web.unc.edu/) and [Shankar Bhamidi](http://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/). Throughout my degree I was an active member of a working group in the [GTEX Project](https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx), and part of the [Probability Group at UNC](http://probabilitygroup.web.unc.edu/).
