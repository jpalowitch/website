I’m a Research Scientist at [Google](http://hooli.com/) interested in language, graphs, and information ecosystems. I did a doctorate in statistics at UNC Chapel Hill with a [dissertation](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/downloads/3j3333508) focused on community detection. My advisors were [Andrew Nobel](http://nobel.web.unc.edu/) and [Shankar Bhamidi](http://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/). For much of my degree I was an active member of a working group in the [GTEX Project](https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx) led by Andrew and [Fred Wright](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/fawrigh2/). My first-authored publications are listed below. Check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fguoChwAAAAJ&hl=en) for others. You can also find me in Google corp spaces such as [my persons page](https://research.google/people/john-palowitch/) and [this blog post](https://blog.research.google/2022/05/graphworld-advances-in-graph.html).

I also have a second life as a musician. If you're in the Bay Area and you like jazz, R&B, and hip-hop, come see me play: [jpalomusic.com](https://www.jpalomusic.com).
